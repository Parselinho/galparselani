            <h5>Tomer & Alon Marketing and Publicity, Ramat Gan - System Manager and Team Leader</h5>
            <p>March 2019 - November 2022</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                The company operates in the forex and bitcoin industry, specializing in connecting affiliates with brokers.
                </li>
                <li>
                My work involved handling operations across various countries, each with several affiliates and brands. My responsibilities included analyzing statistics and adjusting the system accordingly. For instance, if Brand 'A' performed exceptionally in the United Kingdom with Affiliate 'A' between 12:00-17:00, I would prioritize it in the system, followed by the arrangement of subsequent brands. This process was replicated for each country and affiliate based on specific regional data.
                </li>
                <li>
                Success Example: When I joined the company, there were only 0-2 deposits in Hungary per month. However, within four months, we achieved over 200 deposits during peak months, with an average of 50 deposits in subsequent months.
                </li>
                <li>
                Another Example: Initially, when I suggested exploring brand opportunities in India, my manager was skeptical, citing a lack of prior deposits in the region and extensive industry experience. Despite this, I insisted on the potential in the Indian market. As a result, we identified a brand that consistently generated an average of 70 deposits per month
                </li>
                <li>
                Additionally, I successfully managed an average of 13,000 leads per day single-handedly. Currently, this volume of work is distributed among three people, each handling 3-4K leads per day.
                </li>
                <li>
                Conducted comprehensive data analysis, extracting actionable insights to guide strategic decision-making.
                </li>
                <li>
